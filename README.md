# Gans Context DataSets
Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) Context Datasets is Sponsored by Rauxa

# Current state of GANs
GANs do not have any context when generating images: hence GAN generated images of folding chairs look like this

# Purpose & Code Description
Starting this repository to give GANs context from 3D models to generate realistic images of chairs like this 

(real images of chairs from the internet)

3DModel-to-2DImage-Generator.py in this repo reads 3D models with .STL extensions and uses elevation, azimuth & distance to generate images of the 3D model from every possible position

The code in this repo rotates a 3D model around it's (x, y, z) axis to generate an image of the model from every angle

The purpose of this dataset is to train a GAN model to generate realistic images of a chair from any perspective and to move the research into having GANs generate complex realistic scenes

Realistic scenes will be generatd by GANs with multiple models that have full context of an object i.e. car, tree, road, sky, building, people, sign, etc...

# Chair Gans Context Dataset
For our starting point we chose a 3D model of a chair because it is free, small sized and is quick for generating 1+ million 2D images

Link to ChairGansContext dataset goes here <>

ChairGansContext dataset is created with the following: 
* Elevation range 0 to 180 degrees, with an increment of 1 degree
* Azimuth range 0 to 360 degrees, with an increment of 1 degree
* Distance range 5 to 25, with an increment of 1

ChairGansContext dataset only has one class "chair"

The naming convention for images: elev(E)-azim(A)-dist(D).png
* Where E has a range from 0 to 180
* Where A has a range from 0 to 360
* Where D has a range from 5 to 25
